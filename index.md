# Open Source Software

The City of Bloomington is committed to using and contributing to open source software. Software that we write is released under GPL. Whenever possible, development takes place in public project hosting, such as GitHub, Google Code, and SourceForge.

Bloomington's first release was the content manager for http://bloomington.in.gov . The content manager is an open source project, hosted at Google Code: [Civic CMS](http://code.google.com/p/civic-cms). Feel free to review its the source code and see how it works. Additional information about [the website and its features](http://bloomington.in.gov/webtech) can be found here.

One of the best places to explore our open source efforts is at our [Bloomington Civic Commons](http://civiccommons.org/government-entities/bloomington) profile page. [Civic Commons](http://civiccommons.org) is a non-profit initiative that helps governments build and use shared and open technologies to improve public services, transparency, accountability, citizen participation, and management effectiveness, all while saving money.

If you have questions or comments about this or other products, email webmaster@bloomington.in.gov and your comments will be directed to the right staff member. You can also communicate with the project teams at the project sites.

# General LAMP Help Documentation
The site contains general installation and administration document for most all of our software.  Most of our applications are web applications, written in PHP.  These application are all written using pretty much the same architecture, and the requirements and installation process is the same.

We were getting to the point where the general installation information contained in the individual project wiki's was becoming hard to keep up to date across all projects.  So, we've moved all the general documentation to this website.  This means each project need only worry about documenting things that are specific for that project.
