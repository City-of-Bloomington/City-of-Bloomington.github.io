# Installation

With a large number of projects and a small team, keeping documentation current is a challenge. 

We're using Ansible to help us maintain up-to-date representations of the systems that run our software. To get started with Ansible, please see our guide available here:

[Ansible Guide](https://github.com/City-of-Bloomington/system-playbooks)

From there, you can find Ansible roles that help configure our applications in an 'ansible' subdirectory of the project itself. 

Even if you choose not to use ansible, or if you have a different configuration management system in use, the corresponding tasks/main.yml is a good place to see the steps involved with the configuration.
